Toolkit to make FletcherBuilding Service Desk Tasks easier

Would like have the ability to:
- Ping
- What machine the user is logged into
- User's AD information, email address, last login time/date, username, etc
- Have a form for each task so it looks tidy
- 

Still a whole lot of work in progress
